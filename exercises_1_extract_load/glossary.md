**SYSADMIN** - a *SYSADMIN* plays a vital role in setting up, securing and maintaining the infrastructure that supports the data warehouse. They ensure that the systems are reliable, up-to-date and capable of handling the data warehouse's requirements throught its its lifecycle.
**USERADMIN** - Is responsible for managing user accounts and access permissions within an organization's IT system. They handle tasks like creating and deleting user accounts, assigning roles, setting up passwords and ensuring that users have the apprioprate access to systems and data based on their roles.
Summary: A user admin is crucual in managing who can access the data warehouse and what they can do within it. They ensure that the right people have the right access levels, protecting sensitive data and maintaining security throughout the data warehouse's operations.
**ORGADMIN** - plays a key role in aligning the data warehouse's structure and access controls with the organization's hierarchy and policies. They manage user roles and persmissions, ensuring that data access aligns with business needs while maintaining security and compliance. THis helps in efficient data management and secure operations within the data warehouse environment.
**SECURITYADMIN** - ensures that the data stored and processed within the warehouse is secure. They implement access controls, monitor for suspicious activities, and enforce security policies to protect sensitive information. This role is essential in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the data warehouse.
**ACCOUNTADMIN** - Manages the user accounts that have access to the data warehouse. They ensure that users are properly autheticated and have the correct access levels based on their roles. This role is crucial for maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized personnel can access or manipulate the data within the warehouse.
**role inheritance** - Is a concept in access control where a user role can inherit permissions from another role. This means that a role can automatically receive the persmissions of its parent role, making it easire to manage complex permission structures. For example , if a "manager" role inherits from a "user" role, anyone assigned the "manager" role automatically has all the permissions of the "user" role, plus any additional permissions specific to "manager".
Summary: role inheritance is used to simplify the management of user permissions. AS the data warehouse grows and more users need accessm role inheritance allows for efficient and scalable permission management. This helps maintain security and consistency in access control as the data warehouse evolves. (For instance, different roles like "analyst", "data engineer" and "admin" can be set up with inherited permissions, ensuring that each role has the appropriate level of access to data and tools).
**PUBLIC role** - Is a default role in many database and data warehouse systems that automatically uncludes all users. Any persimissions granted to the public role are accessible by every user in the system. THis role is often used to grant basic, non-sensitive permissions that should be universally available, such as the ability to view certain data or use specific tools.
Summary: The public role is useful for managing perimissions that should be accessible to all users, such as basic read access to certain datasets or access to common tools and functions. However, it must be used carefully to avoid unintentionally exposing sensitive data or functions. Proper management of public role ensures that while essential resources are easily accesible, the security and integrity of the data warehouse are maintained throughout its lifecycle.
**public schema** - Is a default schema in many database systems that is accessible to all users. A schema is a container that holds database objects like tables, views and procedures. The public schema allows for common objects to be available to all users by default, without needing specific permissions for each object. 
Summary: The public schema is used to store objects that need to be accessible to all users or applications. For instance, it might contain shared reference data or commonly used views that are relevant to all users. While it simplifies access to common resources, it's important to carefully manage what is placed in the public schema to ensure sensistive data remains secure and that access controls are appropriately enforced throughout the lifecycle of the data warehouse.
