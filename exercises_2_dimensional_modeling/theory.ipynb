    "### Why should you use surrogate keys in dimensional and fact tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrogate keys are fundamental in dimensional modeling, particularly in data warehouse design.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. * Uniqueness & simplicity:\n",
    "* What: Surrogate keys are artificial, unique indetifiers that represent a record in a table.\n",
    "* Why important: Unlike natural keys (like a customer's name or email), surrogate keys are simpler and always unique, even if data changes. This makes them perfect for ensuring referential integrity between dimension and fact tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. * Decoupling from business logic:\n",
    "* What: Surrogate keys are indenpendent of the business meaning of the data.\n",
    "* Why important: Business rules change over time (e.g changes in product codes or customer IDs), but surrogate keys remain stable, allowing the structure of the data warehouse to remain unaffected by these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. * Consistency across systems:\n",
    "* What: Surrogate keys help to unify data from multiple systems.\n",
    "* Why important: If you integrate data from different systems, the same customer might have different IDs in different systems. Surrogate keys provide a uniform indentifier across these systems, simplifying joins and analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. * Handling slowly changing dimensions (SCD):\n",
    "* What: SUrrogate keys are critical when dealing with slowly changing dimensions, especially type 2 SCD.\n",
    "* Why important: Surrogate keys allow you to track historical changes. For example, if a customer's address changes, a new surrogate key can represent the new record, allowing the warehouse to store both the old and new addresses while maintaining referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. * Efficient indexing & performance:\n",
    "* What: Surrogate keys streamline joins between fact and dimension tables.\n",
    "* Why important: Indexing surrogate keys is much faster and more efficient than indexing long, complex natural keys (e.g., text fields or composite keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. * Join efficiency:\n",
    "* What: Surrogate keys streamline joins between fact and dimension tables.\n",
    "* Why important: Since surrogate keys are often smaller, single-field keys (usually integers), they improve the speed and efficiency of joins in large data warehouses, reducing query execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summary: In both dimensional and fact tables, surrogate keys provide simplicity, stability and efficiency, especially in scenarios involving historical data, complex joins and integration across systems. They also help manage evolving business data without disrupting the data warehouse. "

    "### How do you model to associate a fact table with its dimensions?\n",
    "1. Fact table cointains foreign keys:\n",
    "* What: The fact table holds foreign keys to link to the corresponding dimension tables.\n",
    "* Why important: Each foreign key  in the fact table references the surrogate key in a dimension table, which enables easy lookups and joins. This is the core structure that links dimensions (e.g., products, customers, time) to the metrics in the fact tables (e.g. sales, revenue).\n",
    "Example: In a sales fact table:\n",
    "fct_sales:\n",
    "    customer_key (foreign key to customer dimension)\n",
    "    product_key (foreign key to product dimension)\n",
    "    date_key (foreign key to date dimension)\n",
    "2. Granularity of the fact table:\n",
    "* What: The granularity of a fact table defines the level of detail it records.\n",
    "* Why important: The grain must align with the level of each dimension. If a fact table tracks sales at a daily, product, and customer level, it must have a foreign key for each of those dimensions. This ensures that metrics (like sales) match the appropriate level of detail (e.g., daily sales per product per customer)\n",
    "3. Conformed dimensions:\n",
    "* What: Conformed dimensions are dimensions that can be shared across different fact tables.\n",
    "* Why important: These standardized dimensions ensure consistency across the data warehouse. For example, if both sales and inventory facts use the same product dimension, they'll share a common product_key, allowing easy cross-table reporting.\n",
    "* Example: The date dimension may be shared across multiple fact tables, such as sales and returns, ensuring that dates are consistently represented across all analyses.\n",
    "4. Fact table measures and aggregation:\n",
    "* What: The measures in a fact table are typically numeric values that can be aggregated (e.g. sum, count, average).\n",
    "* Why important: Dimensions provide the context for these measures. WHen querying the data, the foreign key relationships between fact and dimension tables allows you to roll up measures by any dimension (e.g. totalt sales by customer, product or date). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example in fact_sales table:\n",
    "* Measures: sales_amount, quantity_sold\n",
    "* Foreign keys: product_key, customer_key, date_key\n",
    "* You can sum sales_amount by any dimension (e.g. total sales by product, by customer or by date).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Star schema design:\n",
    "* What: The star schema is the simplest and most common data warehouse schema, with the fact table at the center and dimension tables around it.\n",
    "* Why important: This design is intuitive and efficient for quering. The relationships between fact and dimension tables create a \"star\" shape, which is easy to understand and allows for fast query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in a sales star schema:\n",
    "* Fact table: fact_sales\n",
    "* Dimension table: dim_customer, dim_product, dim_date\n",
    "* Queries can easily retrieve facts (e.g. sales) linked to dimensions (e.g. products, customers, dates).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Foreign key integrity:\n",
    "* Why: Foreign key relationships between fact and dimension tables ensure that referential integrity.\n",
    "Why important: Every foreign key in the fact table must match a primary key in the dimension table. THis ensures that all facts are linked to valid dimension records, avoiding orphaned or mismatched data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summary: To model a fact table with its dimensions, focus on the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fact tables contain foreign keys pointing to dimension tables.\n",
    "* The granularity of the fact table must align with the dimensions.\n",
    "* Use conformed dimensions across fact tables for consistency.\n",
    "* Organize data in a star schema for simplicity and performance."

    "### c) Why is it not good to anticipate business requirements through preslicing and dicing the data?\n",
    "1. Business requirements change:\n",
    "* What: Business needs evolve over time.\n",
    "* Why important: If you predefine how data should be sliced and diced, you risk building a structure that dosen't adapt easily when new questions arise. The data warehouse should be flexible enough to accommodate unforseen queries, metrics and dimensions. \n",
    "* Example: Of you pre-slice sales data by region and product type, you might later find the business needs a breakdown by customer segment, which wasen't anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduces flexibility:\n",
    "* What: Pre-slicing data locks it into specific categories or groupings.\n",
    "* Why important: This lack of flexibility limits users from performing ad hoc analysis. The goal of a data warehouse is to empower users to explore data dynamically without being constrained by predefined structures.\n",
    "* Example: If you pre-slices sales data by region and product type, you might later find the business needs a breakdown by customer segment, which wasn't anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data explosion:\n",
    "* What: Pre-slicing and predicing can result in data explosion, where the warehouse holds a massive number of unnecessary aggregated views.\n",
    "* Why important: Storing pre-aggregated data at many different levels increases storage needs and maintenance complexity, without guaranteeing that the aggregates will be useful in the future. It's better to store raw, detailed data and let users aggregate as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loss of granularity:\n",
    "* What: Pre-aggregating data leads to a loss of detail (granularity).\n",
    "* Why important: When the data is pre-aggregated, you lose access to the most detailed level of information. This can be problematic when deeper analysis is needed. Keeping data at its most granular level allows maximum flexibility in analysis.\n",
    "* Example: If sales data is pre-aggregated by month, you lose the ability to analyze daily trends without reverting to the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modern tools and performance:\n",
    "* What: Modern data processing tools and databases (like columnar storage, in-memory processing and OLAP-cubes) are optimized for on-demand slicing and dicing.\n",
    "* Why important: The need for preslicing data has diminished because modern tools can efficiently handle dynamic queries and aggregations. It's better to let users define their own slices based on their current needs rather than anticipating every potential query.\n",
    "* Example: A modern OLAP system can handle slicing sales data by any dimension (e.g. product, region, customer) on the fly, without needing pre-aggregated tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summary: Preslicing and predicing data reduces the flexibility, risks data explosion, and leads to a loss of granularity, while failing to adapt to changing business requirements. Modern tools are optimized for on demand data slicing, making it more efficient to keep detailed, raw data and let users aggregate based on their needs.\n",

    "### d) Give examples of facts that are additive, semi-additive and non-additive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the different types of facts, additive, semi-additive and non-additive is crucial when working with fact tables in a warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Additive Facts:\n",
    "- What: Additive facts can be summed across any dimension.\n",
    "- Why important: These are the most common and easiest facts to work with since they can be aggregated across all dimensions (e.g. time, geography, product).\n",
    "<br> Example: Sales amount: You can sum sales across different time periods, customers and products.\n",
    "* Quantity sold: Total quantity sold can be aggregated across any dimension.</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Semi-additive facts:\n",
    "- What: Semi-additive facts can be summed across some dimensions but not others.\n",
    "- Why important: These facts require more careful handling when reporting, as they behave differently depending on the dimension. The most common semi-additive facts involve time, where aggregation over time dosen't make sense.\n",
    "<br> Example: \n",
    "- Account balance: You can sum balances across customers or products, but not over time (e.g. summing balances for January, February and March dosen't make sense).\n",
    "- Inventory levels: You can sum inventory across products or locations, but not over time, since it's a snapshot at a point of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Non-additive facts:\n",
    "- What: Non-additive facts cannot be summed across on dimension.\n",
    "- Why important: These facts often require special handling though **calculations or ratios**, and you can't aggregate them directly. They are usually percentage or ratios.\n",
    "<br>Example: **Profit margin**: You cannot sum profit margin across products or time. Instead, you need to compute a new profit margin based on total profit and total revenue.</br>\n",
    "<br>**Percentage of completion**: You can't sum percentages (e.g.) summing 50% complete for two projects does not result in 100% completion.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "<br>Summary: \n",
    "<br>__Additive facts__:</br> (e.g. sales amount, quantity sold) can be summed across all dimensions.\n",
    "<br>__Semi-additive__ facts:</br> (e.g. account balance, inventory) can be summed accross some dimensions, but not time.\n",
    "<br>__Non-additive facts__:</br> (e.g. profit margin, percentages) cannot be summed across any dimension and require special calculations.</br>"

    "### Which SCD is most commonly used and how does it work?\n",
    "The most commonly used __Slowly changing dimensions__(SCD) type is SCD type 2. It helps track historical changes in dimension data, which is crucial for accurate reporting and analysis over time.\n",
    "__1. What is SCD type 2?__\n",
    "* What: SCD Type 2 tracks historical changes by creating a new row in the dimension table each time an update occurs, while keeping the old data.\n",
    "* Why important: It allows you to maintain both current and historical data, which is crucial for accurate analysis over time. This is useful when you need to track how a customeräs details have changed or how a product's information evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. How SCD Type 2 works__:\n",
    "* What: When an update occurs, instead of overwriting the old record, a new record with a new surrogate key is added. The old record is kept for historical reference.\n",
    "* key fields:\n",
    "    * Surrogate key: A unique identifier that changes with each version of the record.\n",
    "    * Versioning or date fields: Typically, `effective_date` and `end_date` fields are used to mark when each version of the record was active.\n",
    "    * Current flag: Sometimes a flag (e.g. \"is_current\") is used to indicate the most recent record.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    * Original customer record:\n",
    "        * `customer_key = 101`, `customer_name = John`, `city = Stockholm`, `effective_date = 2020-01-01`, `end_date = NULL`\n",
    "    * After a change (e.g. customer moves)\n",
    "        * Old record: `customer_key = 101`, `customer_name = John`, `city = Stockholm`, `effective_date = 2020-01-01`, `effective_date ? 2020-01-01` `end_date = 2022-06-01`\n",
    "        * New record: `customer_key = 102`, `customer_name = John`, `city = Göteborg`, `effective_date = 2020-01-01`, `end_date = NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Advantages of SCD Type 2__:\n",
    "* What: SCD Type 2 ensures that historical data is preserved while allowing you to track changes over time.\n",
    "* Why important: This method is extremely valuable for time-bades analysis, such as tracking customer or product changes over years, allowing accurate reporting for both past and current data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Challenges with SCD Type 2__:\n",
    "* What: THe main challenge is __data growth__ -- since a new row is added for every change, the dimension table can grow significantly over time.\n",
    "* Why important: You need to manage larger tables and ensure the (ETL) process handles these changes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary__:\n",
    "* SCD Type 2 is the most common method used because it tracks historical changes by adding a new row for each update.\n",
    "* It involves using __surrogate keys__, __effective and end dates__, and sometimes a __current flag__ to keep track of which records are the most recent.\n",
    "* This method provides __accurate historical analysis__ but can lead to __data growth__ challenges as new versions of records are added over time.\n",

    "1. __What is Date Dimension__?\n",
    "* __What__: A date dimension is a table in a data warehouse that contains detailed information about __each date__ (e.g. year, quarter, month, day) and other attributes such as __day of the week__, __fiscal periods__, and __holidays__.\n",
    "* __Why important__: It provides a consistent and standardized way to track time-related attributes, making it easier to analyze data over different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Purpose of a Date Dimension__:\n",
    "* __What__: The date dimension allows for __time-based analysis__ (e.g. by day, month, quarter or year) and supports complex queries like __year-over-year comparisons__, __trends__, __seasonality__, __and time intelligence__.\n",

    "* __What__: The date dimension typically includes attributes like:\n",
    "    * __Date key__: A unique identifier (often an integer) for each date.\n",
    "    * __Date__: Actual date (e.g. 2024-09-01).\n",
    "    * __Year, quarter, month, day__: Breakdown of the date.\n",
    "    * __Weekday/weekend__: Whether the date is a weekday or weekend.\n",
    "    * __Fiscal year/quarter/period__: For organizations that use fiscal calenders.\n",

    "1. __What is ephemeral materialization__?\n",
    "* __What__: Ephemeral materialization in dbt means that the model is __not persisted__ in the data warehouse as a table or view. Instead, it is treated as __in-memory CTE (Common table expression)__ or __subquery__ that is used within downstream models.\n",
    "* __Why important__: It helps reduce the unnecessary storage usage and speeds up data processing by avoiding the creation of physical tables for intermediate transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Purpose of ephemeral models__:\n",
    "* __What__: They are typically used for __intermediate logic__ or __reusable transformations__ that don't need to be stored permanently.\n",
    "* __Why important__: WHen the same logic or transformations is used in multiple downstream models, ephemeral materialization allows you to __reuse to logic__ without saving redundant data at each step.\n",

    "3. __Improves performance for temporary transformations__:\n",
    "* __What__: Ephemeral models are especially useful when you're performing transformations that are only needed temporarily during query execution.\n",
    "* __Why important__: Since the data is not pysically stored, it avoids the overhead of creating and managing intermediate tables, which can improve query performance in certain cases.\n",
